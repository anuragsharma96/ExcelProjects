# ExcelProjects
This project list contains projects I completed during my training session att Able Jobs. I would like to bring under your kind notice that due to some unprecedented errors with macros, Amazon(Solution) couldn't be updated, but are still completed to the best possible extent.
In these projects I learnt how to mak edifferent sheets, how to manupilate and filter out data into different sheets using different functions and also how to use macros in addition with pivot tables and using multiple tables for a single pivot table.
Furthermore, the data is meant to be used only for fair educational purposes, and the projects so uploaded are not meant to be copied in any form.
I will be uploading more projects in the near future.
Thank You
Best wishes.
